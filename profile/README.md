OneDL is an industry focused AI platform designed to support the entire lifecycle of your AI applications. 
Your team can directly focus on application development while saving time on developing IT tools for data management, data format conversions and stitching together open-source tools.
The OpenMMLabs vision and deep learning libraries are part of that.

We forked these libraries so we can update them with latest improvements and we want to give back to the open source community what we gained as well:
Access to a great deep learning training tool with the latest models from academia.

For now we focus ourselves on the most used repositories:

- [OneDL-PreTrain](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmpretrain): Pre-training and classificationtoolbox and benchmark.
- [OneDL-Detection](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmdetection): Object detection and instance segmentation toolbox and benchmark.
- [OneDL-Segmentation](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmsegmentation): Semantic segmentation toolbox and benchmark.
- [OneDL-Deploy](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmdeploy): Model deployment framework.
- [OneDL-Rotate](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmrotate): Rotated object detection toolbox and benchmark.

And their dependencies:
- [OneDL-MIM](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mim): MIM installs VBTI  packages.
- [OneDL-Engine](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmengine): Foundational library for training deep learning models.
- [OneDL-CV](https://github.com/vbti-development/onedl-mmcv): Foundational library for computer vision.

We are only a small team, so any help will be appreciated.
